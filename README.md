## Title - Vehicle Detection and Number Plate Reading

## ABSTRACT

This report introduces an integrated automation framework tailored for efficient real-time vehicle detection and number plate recognition. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as the YOLOv5 object detection model for vehicle detection, DeepSORT for continuous vehicle tracking, and the Tesseract OCR engine for character recognition in automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) systems, the framework ensures seamless detection, tracking, and 
recognition of vehicles and their associated number plates in real-time. The YOLOv5 model offers high-performance vehicle detection capabilities, utilizing advanced convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to achieve superior accuracy and processing speed, thus making it well-suited for real-time surveillance applications. DeepSORT facilitates continuous vehicle tracking by utilizing a combination of motion and appearance data to maintain robust tracking of vehicles over time, ensuring accurate monitoring and tracking throughout their trajectories, even in challenging urban environments. Furthermore, the ANPR system, through the use of the Tesseract OCR engine, enables precise character recognition on cropped vehicle images, allowing for the extraction of complete license plate numbers. This comprehensive technology solution not only offers significant benefits for traffic management and security operations in urban settings but also empowers law enforcement agencies with valuable tools for monitoring 
and enforcing traffic regulations. The seamless integration of state-of-the-art technologies in this framework represents a substantial advancement in real-time vehicle surveillance, promising smoother traffic flow and enhanced security in city environments. However, further research and development efforts are warranted to optimize and refine the framework for broader deployment and application in real-world scenarios.
